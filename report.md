Good afternoon Dr Chan, good afternoon everyone.

My name is Chen Yuanhong and today I'm presenting the progress update for our capstone project.

Can everyone see my shared screen? 

So, rather than using the traditional PowerPoint slides, we've developed an interactive website to showcase our project. 

The website serves as both our project documentation and a technical demonstration

providing a more comprehensive and engaging way to understand our work. 

Let's walk through the website, starting with the homepage.

The project is called “A Machine Learning-Based Model for Predicting Fund Transactions”.

It aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast daily fund subscription and redemption amounts. 

We're integrating multiple data sources, including historical transactions, market indicators, and fund characteristics, to create a comprehensive analysis framework.

Our goal is to develop advanced machine learning models capable of handling both normal and abnormal market conditions, while establishing a thorough evaluation framework to measure and validate model performance.

This integrated approach will enable us to provide accurate predictions that can assist in fund management and risk assessment.

The scope of our project encompasses data collection, model development, system implementation, and performance evaluation, with a focus on practical applicability in real-world fund management scenarios."
